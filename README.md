A project that sends users a daily email messages detailing an influential LGBT person through history. This project can be found at lgbtthroughhistory.com and is currently being hosted on Heroku. The front end uses React and the backend is Node with Mongo. The messages are sent utilizing an API provided by MailGun. The payment processing is handled by Stripe. The project is complete with error logging and phone input validation. This is my first production application, I am very proud of it and learned an absolute ton while making it and am still learning by maintaining it.
